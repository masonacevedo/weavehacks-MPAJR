# Debugging Guide for Weavehacks2025 Extension

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. "Error: Could not communicate with page"

This error occurs when the side panel can't communicate with the content script. Here's how to debug:

#### Step 1: Check if you're on the right page
- Make sure you're on `twitter.com` or `x.com`
- The extension only works on Twitter/X pages

#### Step 2: Check the browser console
1. Open the side panel
2. Right-click in the side panel and select "Inspect"
3. Look for console messages that start with "Weavehacks2025"
4. Check for any error messages

#### Step 3: Check the main page console
1. Go to the Twitter/X page
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Look for console messages from the content script
4. You should see: "Weavehacks2025 content script loaded"

#### Step 4: Reload the extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Weavehacks2025"
3. Click the refresh/reload button
4. Refresh the Twitter/X page

#### Step 5: Check extension permissions
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click "Details" on the Weavehacks2025 extension
3. Make sure all permissions are granted

### 2. Content Script Not Loading

If you don't see "Weavehacks2025 content script loaded" in the console:

1. Check the manifest.json file is correct
2. Reload the extension
3. Refresh the Twitter/X page
4. Check if the page URL matches the patterns in manifest.json

### 3. No Tweets Found

If the extension loads but no tweets appear:

1. Make sure you're on a page with tweets (not just the login page)
2. Try scrolling down to load more tweets
3. Click the "ðŸ”„ Refresh Tweets" button
4. Check the console for debugging messages about tweet extraction

### 4. Extension Icon Not Working

If clicking the extension icon doesn't open the side panel:

1. Make sure you're on a Twitter/X page
2. Check if the side panel is already open
3. Try right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Open side panel"

## Console Messages to Look For

### Successful Loading:
- "Weavehacks2025 background script loaded"
- "Weavehacks2025 content script loaded"
- "Side panel loaded"
- "Found X tweets with selector: ..."

### Error Messages:
- "Content script not ready yet"
- "Chrome runtime error: ..."
- "No active tab found"
- "Not on Twitter/X"

## Manual Testing

1. Go to `twitter.com` or `x.com`
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. In the console, type: `document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid="tweet"]')`
4. This should return tweet elements if the page has tweets

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Make sure you're using a recent version of Chrome
3. Try disabling other extensions that might interfere
4. Check if the Twitter/X page structure has changed (the selectors might need updating)
