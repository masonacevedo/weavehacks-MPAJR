<h1>Freemasonry Hackathon</h1>
<p>Web application and supporting browser extension for scraping content from sites providing community product information (such as Reddit) or news information.  The application filters for relevant information based on search criteria.  Also shows “most recommended”, “newest”, “trending”, etc.

In the web application, you can type searches into the lower right, which will generate responses based on LLM content and ingested content.

You can also get recommended responses by from the LLM, and (after accepting them), cause them to be posted to the community sites.

In addition, the supporting browser extension provides this functionality (or a subset of it) as an add-in for Reddit, etc.
